## Hand Gesture Recognition

Hand gesture recognition is a compelling application of computer vision, which has seen significant advancements due to the progress in deep learning techniques and the accessibility of high-quality datasets. The ability to recognize hand gestures accurately can be transformative in various fields, including human-computer interaction, assistive technologies for the hearing impaired, augmented reality, and robotics.

In this project, we will develop a hand gesture recognition model using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. Our approach will employ the MobileNetV2 architecture, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) known for its efficiency and accuracy. By fine-tuning this pre-trained model on the ["Hand Gesture Recognition Database"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog/data) dataset sourced from Kaggle, we aim to achieve high accuracy in classifying specific hand gestures.
